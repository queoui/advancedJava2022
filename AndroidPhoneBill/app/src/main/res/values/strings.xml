        This is the README file for the phone bill application!\n\n
The application collects and stores phone calls into an android app with a little help from some text files. If a phone bill does not exist
it will create a new phone bill on the app. If the customer already has a phone bill they can append a new phone call to their already existing one. The purpose is for all
phone calls on a given account to be visible in the customers phone bill. The customer also has the option to search phone calls given a date and time range. Through the
        use of text files the program practices file persistence. Once a phone bill is created it will stay there until the text file is physically deleted from the data
        section of the app. Please enjoy all of the functionality of this app while you keep track of the phone calls you make in a given day.
