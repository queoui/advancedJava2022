##  OVERVIEW ##\n
##############\n\n
This is the README file for the phone bill application!\n
This application collects and stores phone calls into an android app with a little help from some text files. If a phone bill does not exist
it will create a new phone bill on the app. If the customer already has a phone bill append a new phone call to their already existing one. The purpose is for all
phone calls on a given account to be visible in the customers phone bill. The customer also has the option to search phone calls given a date and time range.
